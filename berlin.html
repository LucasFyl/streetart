As a part of the “Street Art Attack” MYMO created the 3rd artwork, half painting, half installation at the nightclub Hotel Shanghai in Essen, where the people get the chance not just to have a look on an artwork but also on the artist herself and how the work has been developed until it was finnished.</p>
