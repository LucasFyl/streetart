            <p>New-York: Big apple, the best city in the world! If you already go to NYC, you may have seen that the street art movement was spectacular in the subway. In a few years, these «tags" have become real fonts. The goal of the North American Graffiti was initially to get the fame, the recognition of other graffiti taggers or their meaning by this that they exist. 
In 1973, New York Magazine launches the first competition finest graffiti subway.
A few years later the graffiti was severely repressed in the New York subway and began to spread on the walls for our best pleasure!
