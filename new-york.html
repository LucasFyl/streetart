In a few years , these " tags" ( signatures) have become real fonts . The goal of the North American Graffiti was initially to get the fame, the recognition of other graffiti taggers or their meaning by this that they exist. Very quickly , standardized styles and practices crystallize . Groups (called " posses ," " crews ," " squads " or " gangs "), as the city of New York has always known , form and allow graffiti artists to come together to perform spectacular feats , to add a collective name for their individual name, but also to compete between groups , peacefully or not. <br/>
